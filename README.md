An educational web app that executes student pseudocode step‑by‑step and explains the logic, mistakes, and reasoning behind errors.

📖 Full Description (for README intro)
Student Logic Compiler is a learning‑focused code interpreter designed to help students understand how their logic works, not just whether their answer is correct.

Unlike traditional compilers that only show syntax errors or final output, this system:

Executes pseudocode step by step

Tracks variable changes during execution

Analyzes the student’s logic path

Explains mistakes in a beginner‑friendly way

Suggests fixes that preserve the student’s original approach

🎯 Goal: Improve problem‑solving and logical thinking, not just produce correct code.
